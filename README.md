# nDPI Beat

#### NodeJS + nDPI FFI Bindings + Elasticsearch Bulk Exporter
This experimental, unoptimized, proof-of-concept application implements a "Beat-like" Elasticsearch Bulk shipper, feeding on nDPI protocol detections from a live capture socket as source. Do NOT use for any purpose other than crashing a thread.
